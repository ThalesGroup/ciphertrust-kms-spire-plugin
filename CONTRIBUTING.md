# Contributing to this project

We welcome your contributions to help us improve and extend this project!

Below you will find some basic steps required to be able to contribute to the project. If you have any questions about this process or any other aspect of contributing to a Bloomberg open source project, feel free to send an email to oss@thalesgroup.com and we'll get your questions answered as quickly as we can.

# Contributing Licence

Since this project is distributed under the terms of an [open source license](https://github.com/ThalesGroup/ciphertrust-kms-spire-plugin/blob/main/LICENSE), contributions that you make are licensed under the same terms. In order for us to be able to accept your contributions, we will need explicit confirmation from you that you are able and willing to provide them under these terms, and the mechanism we use to do this is called a Developer's Certificate of Origin [(DCO)](#dco). This is very similar to the process used by the Linux(R) kernel, Samba, and many other major open source projects.

To participate under these terms, all that you must do is include a line like the following as the last line of the commit message for each commit in your contribution:

```
Signed-Off-By: Random J. Developer <random@developer.example.org>
```

The simplest way to accomplish this is to add `-s` or `--signoff` to your `git commit` command.
You must use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms, and no anonymous contributions).

# DCO

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

1. The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the right to submit it under the open source license indicated in the file; or

2. The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license and I have the right under that license to submit that work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part by me, under the same open source license (unless I am permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated in the file; or

3. The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who certified (1), (2) or (3) and I have not modified it.

4. I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are public and that a record of the contribution (including all personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with this project or the open source license(s) involved.
